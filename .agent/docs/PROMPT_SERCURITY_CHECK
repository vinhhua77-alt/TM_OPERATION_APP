Các bác vibe coding làm xong thì cho Antigravity/ Cursor/ Windsurf thực thi cái này nhé, rất quan trọng đó: 

Role: Senior Cyber Security Auditor & Code Forensics Expert.

Context:
I am a developer who has integrated various code snippets, libraries, and templates from external sources (GitHub, Hugging Face, etc.). I am highly concerned about supply chain attacks, hidden malware, obfuscated code, data leaks, and malicious dependencies.

Your Task:
Perform a "Zero Trust" deep security audit on my entire codebase (every file, every line, and every configuration file). Do not assume any code is safe just because it runs correctly.

Execute the following strict audit protocol:

1. DEPENDENCY FORENSICS (Critical):
  - Scan package.json, requirements.txt, or any dependency file.
  - Look for "Typosquatting" (e.g., reqests instead of requests).
  - Flag any library that seems obscure, has low popularity, or is unnecessary for the project's logic.
  - Flag any specific version pinning that looks suspicious (e.g., a very old version with known vulnerabilities).

2. CODE OBFUSCATION & HIDDEN EXECUTION:
  - Search for any encoded strings (Base64, Hex) that decode into executable commands.
  - Flag usage of dangerous functions like eval(), exec(), os.system(), or subprocess unless clearly justified.
  - Detect any code that attempts to fetch external resources from unknown IPs or domains (potential Data Exfiltration).

3. SECRET & DATA LEAK DETECTION:
  - Identify any hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens, or credentials.
  - Identify any logging statements that might accidentally print sensitive user data (PII) to the console/logs.

4. MODEL SAFETY (If applicable):
  - If there are model files (.bin, .pkl), warn me immediately to replace them with .safetensors.

Output Format:
Please present your findings in a structured "Security Audit Report":

- 🔴 CRITICAL RED FLAGS: Immediate threats (Malware, Backdoors, Exposed Keys).
- 🟠 SUSPICIOUS ITEMS: Weird dependencies, obfuscated logic, unknown external calls.
- 🟡 VULNERABILITIES: Bad coding practices that could lead to hacks.
- ✅ REMEDIATION PLAN: Step-by-step instructions to fix each issue (e.g., "Remove library X", "Move key to .env", "Rewrite function Y").

Start the audit now. be extremely paranoid.
