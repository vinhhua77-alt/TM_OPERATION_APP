# OPS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM v3.0

**Philosophy**: Daily Operation (Evidence) + Shiftlog (Behavior) + Engine (Analysis)

---

## 1. CORE PROBLEM (v1/v2 Limitation)
Previously, Daily Operations (Checklists) and Shiftlogs (Stories) were isolated. We couldn't answer **WHY** a store was failing or succeeding. 

---

## 2. THE INTELLIGENCE LOGIC
> **Shiftlog = Process**
> **Daily Operation = Outcome**
> **Ops Intelligence = Cause → Effect**

### 2.1. Integrated View
- **Shift Layer (Micro)**: Shiftlogs, Tasks, Incidents, People/Equipment states.
- **Daily Layer (Macro)**: 5S, Hygiene, Revenue, Waste, Inventory, Compliance.
- **Intelligence Layer**: Pattern Detection, Root Cause Mapping, Action Recommendations.

---

## 3. DATA MODEL PRINCIPLES
- **Axis**: Store → Date → Shift (People, Task, Incident, Equipment).
- **No Double Entry**: Daily Metrics are aggregated from Shifts + minimal end-of-day inputs.

---

## 4. ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES
- **Waste Analysis**: Link Waste ↑ to specific shifts/leaders/missing training.
- **5S Degradation**: Detect if failure is a "Peak Hour" issue vs. a "General Negligence" issue.
- **Leader Evaluation**: Differentiate between "Result-only" leaders (high sales, high waste) and "Operational Masters" (stable system).

---

## 5. SCORING & FLAGS
- **Shift Ops Score**: Reliability + Handling + Readiness.
- **Daily Ops Score**: Hygiene + Waste + Accuracy + Variance.
- **Intelligence Flags**: Human Risk, Process Risk, System Risk.

---

## 6. ENGINE RESPONSIBILITIES
1. **Detect anomaly**: Compare against store baseline.
2. **Link cause–effect**: Shift events → Daily outcomes.
3. **Classify problem**: Human, Process, or Equipment.
4. **Suggest action**: Traceable management recommendations.

---

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
1. **Phase 1**: Standardized Shiftlogs + Lean Daily Ops entry.
2. **Phase 2**: Atomic Aggregation & Ops Scoring.
3. **Phase 3**: Intelligence Engine & AI Recommendations.

## 8. RULE CATALOG
Detailed rule definitions (IF → THEN) for all operational domains are documented in [RULE_CATALOG_V3.md](./RULE_CATALOG_V3.md).
